// Regression test for the half_snake CUDA fusion's aliasing guard.
//
// The fusion collapses the seven nodes NanoCodec's activation emits -- mul, sin,
// sqr, mul, add, leaky_relu, concat -- into one kernel that reads the activation
// input through two views and writes the concat output. The graph allocator
// plans buffers for the *unfused* sequence, in which the input's last reader is
// the leaky_relu, so the input's memory is free to be recycled for the concat
// output. The fused kernel still reads the input while writing the concat, so
// where the allocator overlapped them at a shifted offset, threads clobbered
// input other threads had not read yet. It cost NanoCodec ~26 dB of SNR against
// a CPU reference, and made the same codes decode differently on every run.
//
// Two things make this awkward to test, and shape what is below.
//
// The arithmetic is correct at every shape in isolation, so a kernel-level unit
// test cannot see the bug -- it only appears once a real graph puts the output
// on top of the input. And the *safe* overlap, where the concat exactly covers
// its two input views end to end, is what a stock allocator produces for this
// shape: every thread then reads and writes one address, which the guard
// deliberately permits. A test that lets the allocator choose therefore passes
// with the guard removed, which is worse than no test.
//
// So this test places the buffers itself: the concat output is put at a
// deliberate byte offset inside the activation input, which is neither disjoint
// nor an exact alias, and is exactly the case the guard must reject. The
// unfused path is unaffected by that placement -- it materialises the snake and
// leaky-relu halves into their own buffers first -- so the reference stays
// valid.

// The fused kernel gives thread `idx` one read of x[idx] and one write of
// dst[idx], and dst sits kOverlapShift bytes into x -- so thread idx clobbers
// the input that thread idx + kOverlapShift/4 has yet to read. Whether that is
// a *detectable* race depends on scheduling, and the sizes below are what make
// it deterministic rather than a coin flip:
//
//   - The grid must exceed what the GPU can hold resident. At 256 threads per
//     block these shapes are 8192 blocks, against the ~1200 a 148-SM GB300 can
//     keep in flight. Blocks far enough apart therefore cannot overlap in time.
//     A small tensor whose blocks are all co-resident fails only ~half the time
//     -- the first version of this test was 512x64, i.e. 128 blocks, and caught
//     the bug in 17 runs out of 30.
//   - The shift must be many blocks, not many bytes, so that the writer has
//     certainly retired before the reader launches. A quarter of the tensor is
//     2048 blocks here, and still overlaps both input views partially, which is
//     the case the guard has to reject.
